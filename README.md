## Just a little thing that I've made in 5 minutes to get a beta code.

# How to install (cba to make an installer)
- Install node.js 12.18.3 and execute `npm -i` in cmd/bash
- Go to callofduty.com/betaredeem and do a post request (just paste some bs in there and submit) to get your cookie
- Paste the cookie into cookie.txt
- Join the treyarch discord (discord.gg/treyarch)
- Get your discord login token (https://youtu.be/ylC8d5Poa_g?t=132) and paste it into the var `token` in `index.js`
- Start the batch `start.bat` and you're ready to go

# Removed code because it will most likely get revoked but dude trust me, it works
